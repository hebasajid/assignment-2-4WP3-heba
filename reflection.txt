One of the main issues I encountered during development 
was a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to fetch
weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API (Hash Number: 94a3960120fc950fb95a71109253b2ee12bcbeb6).
This was causing the results to show "Undefined". The 
frontend AJAX request seemed right but the server was crashing during the API call. After debugging, I discovered 
that I was using a variable (apiUnits) in the axios request before 
defining it. Because JavaScript throws a ReferenceError when an undefined 
variable is accessed, this caused the Express route to fail and return a 500 error.
This helped me learn that external API keys can take time to activate, and server-side errors can sometimes 
originate from third-party API responses rather than frontend code.
The issue was resolved by properly defining the apiUnits variable
before using it in the axios request and confirming that the API
key had activated.
Another issue I encountered that I was able to resolve was, doing some error handling.
I wanted the app to show the user that if they entered an input in the city input with numbers; the form would show
an error, and if they entered a city that doesn't exist; it would not fetch any data 
(Hash Number: e6dda241775308548d1741e2ae9557c130d94f8d), because before 
any error handling it would show the results as 'Undefined'. I had some trouble implementing
this but to resolve this, I implemented a custom displayError function in my script.js and
added logic to check the response.ok status of my AJAX fetch request. I learned how to pass 
specific error messages from my Node.js backend to the front-end in JSON format so that I could 
inform the user of the issue rather than "dumping" a generic error message.
